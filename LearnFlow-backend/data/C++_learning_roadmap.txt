## 🛣️ C++ Learning Roadmap

### 🟢 1. **Getting Started with C++**

> **Goal:** Understand how to write, compile, and run simple C++ programs.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Installing a compiler: GCC, Clang, or MSVC
* IDEs: Visual Studio, CLion, VS Code, Code::Blocks
* First program: `Hello World`
* Structure of a C++ program
* Input/output with `cin`/`cout`

#### 🧰 Tools:

* Compiler: `g++`, `clang++`
* Online IDEs: repl.it, cpp.sh, HackerRank

---

### 🟡 2. **Basic Syntax and Programming Concepts**

> **Goal:** Get comfortable with the C++ language basics.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Variables and Data Types
* Operators and Expressions
* Control flow: `if`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`
* Functions and Recursion
* Arrays, Strings, and Pointers (intro)

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Write small programs: calculator, palindrome, Fibonacci
* Solve 25-50 beginner problems on HackerRank/LeetCode

---

### 🟠 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

> **Goal:** Understand how C++ supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Classes and Objects
* Constructors and Destructors
* Inheritance (Single, Multi-level, Multiple)
* Polymorphism (compile-time & runtime)
* Encapsulation & Abstraction
* `this` pointer
* Static members and methods

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Build a class-based app (e.g., Library system or Bank system)

---

### 🔵 4. **Intermediate Topics**

> **Goal:** Use modern C++ features and advanced memory management techniques.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Pointers and References
* Dynamic Memory (`new`, `delete`)
* Function Overloading & Operator Overloading
* Templates (Function & Class Templates)
* Exception Handling
* Namespaces
* File I/O
* Introduction to STL

---

### 🟣 5. **Standard Template Library (STL)**

> **Goal:** Master data structures and algorithms using STL.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Containers: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `queue`, `map`, `set`, `unordered_map`
* Iterators
* Algorithms: `sort`, `find`, `binary_search`, `count`, `reverse`
* Lambda Expressions
* Pairs and Tuples
* Time Complexity Considerations

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Solve problems on LeetCode, Codeforces, or AtCoder using STL

---

### 🟤 6. **Advanced C++ (C++11/14/17/20 Features)**

> **Goal:** Write high-performance, modern C++ code.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Smart Pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`)
* Move Semantics and Rvalue References
* Lambda Functions
* Range-based for loops
* `auto`, `decltype`
* `constexpr`, `nullptr`
* Uniform Initialization
* Multithreading (`std::thread`, `mutex`, `future`)
* Concepts (C++20)

---

### 🔘 7. **Specializations**

> Choose a direction depending on your interests.

#### 🔹 🔧 Systems/Embedded Development

* Low-level memory manipulation
* Bit manipulation
* Inline Assembly
* Bare-metal C++
* Build drivers, firmware

#### 🔹 🏆 Competitive Programming

* Master STL & algorithms
* Learn DP, graphs, trees, number theory
* Sites: Codeforces, AtCoder, LeetCode, TopCoder

#### 🔹 🎮 Game Development

* Learn SFML, SDL, or OpenGL
* C++ with Unreal Engine
* Real-time simulation and graphics basics

#### 🔹 🖥️ Application Development

* GUI: Qt, wxWidgets
* Cross-platform tools
* Event-driven programming

---

### 🧠 8. **Build Projects**

> **Goal:** Apply your skills and build a portfolio.

#### 🔸 Project Ideas:

* File compressor or parser
* Inventory or library management system
* 2D Game with SFML
* Chat app using sockets
* Compiler or interpreter (advanced)

## 🎯 Final Advice

* Focus first on **clarity**, then **efficiency**, then **mastery**.
* C++ is deep and complex — take it one layer at a time.
* Use **STL** effectively — it's your secret weapon.
* Read other people’s code on GitHub or forums.
* Learn **memory management and debugging** early.
