Here is a **complete and structured roadmap** for learning the **Go programming language (Golang)** — from beginner to advanced, designed to help you master Go for web development, backend services, systems programming, or cloud-native apps.

---

## 🛣️ Go Programming Language (Golang) Learning Roadmap

---

### 🟢 1. **Getting Started with Go**

> **Goal:** Set up your Go environment and write your first program.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Install Go (`go` toolchain, environment variables)
* Set up `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` (or use Go modules)
* IDEs: VS Code (with Go plugin), GoLand
* Hello World
* Code structure: packages, files, main function

#### 🧰 Tools:

* [golang.org](https://golang.org)
* [go.dev/play](https://go.dev/play) — online playground

---

### 🟡 2. **Core Go Language Features**

> **Goal:** Understand Go's syntax, control flow, and basic types.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Variables and constants
* Primitive types: `int`, `float64`, `bool`, `string`
* Control flow: `if`, `for`, `switch`, `goto`
* Functions and multiple return values
* Error handling (`error` interface, `fmt.Errorf`)
* Packages and imports

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Build basic CLI apps (e.g., calculator, to-do list)
* Solve beginner problems on Go playground or LeetCode

---

### 🟠 3. **Intermediate Go Concepts**

> **Goal:** Write idiomatic, reusable, and organized Go code.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Arrays, slices, and maps
* Structs and methods
* Pointers and memory semantics (pass by value/reference)
* Interfaces and duck typing
* Composition (no inheritance)
* Defer, panic, and recover
* Custom types and type aliases

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Write a basic REST API using `net/http`
* Build a file processor or JSON parser

---

### 🔵 4. **Advanced Go Features**

> **Goal:** Master concurrency and deeper language features.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Goroutines
* Channels and select statements
* Mutexes and WaitGroups
* Context package (`context.Context`)
* Go Modules (`go mod`)
* Error wrapping (`errors.Is`, `errors.As`)
* Reflection and type assertions
* Testing (`testing` package, table-driven tests)

#### 🛠 Practice:

* Build a concurrent data processor or worker pool
* Add unit tests and benchmarks to your projects

---

### 🟣 5. **Standard Library & Tooling**

> **Goal:** Get fluent with Go’s rich standard library and development tools.

#### 🔸 Libraries:

* `fmt`, `time`, `os`, `io`, `bytes`, `strings`
* `net/http`, `encoding/json`, `bufio`
* `log`, `math`, `regexp`, `sync`

#### 🔧 Tooling:

* `go fmt`, `go vet`, `go run`, `go build`
* `go test`, `go mod tidy`, `go get`
* `golint`, `staticcheck`, `benchstat`

---

### 🟤 6. **Specializations (Choose Your Path)**

> Choose based on your interest or career path.

#### 🔹 🕸️ Web Development / APIs

* `net/http`, `mux`, `gin`, `echo`
* Middleware, routing, and request context
* Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
* Database access: `database/sql`, `gorm`, `sqlx`
* Validation and serialization

#### 🔹 ☁️ Cloud / DevOps

* Build CLI tools
* Dockerize Go apps
* Use Go for Kubernetes controllers
* Work with AWS SDK, GCP client libraries

#### 🔹 ⚙️ Systems Programming

* File I/O, signals, sockets
* Implement a web server or proxy
* Work with goroutines and channels under high load

#### 🔹 📦 Library/SDK Development

* Create reusable Go packages
* Follow Go module versioning and documentation standards

---

### ⚫ 7. **Projects & Portfolio**

> **Goal:** Apply your knowledge and build real-world experience.

#### 🛠 Project Ideas:

* RESTful API for a blogging platform
* Chat app using WebSockets
* CLI tool for file organization
* Task scheduler
* Custom Go HTTP framework
* Kubernetes custom controller
