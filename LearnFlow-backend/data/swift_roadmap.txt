🛣️ Swift Programming Language Learning Roadmap

---

🟢 1. Getting Started with Swift
Goal: Set up your Swift environment and write your first program.

🔸 Topics:
- Install Xcode / Swift Playgrounds
- Swift CLI (`swiftc`, `swift`)
- Hello, World
- Xcode basics (for macOS/iOS development)
- Swift Playground for experimentation

---

🟡 2. Swift Basics
Goal: Understand Swift’s syntax, types, and control flow.

🔸 Topics:
- Constants and Variables (`let` vs `var`)
- Data Types: Int, Float, Bool, String
- String interpolation
- Operators
- Control Flow: if, switch, for-in, while
- Optionals and Optional Binding
- Functions and Parameters

🛠 Practice:
- Create simple calculators and loops-based programs
- Explore optionals and safely unwrap values

---

🟠 3. Collections and Enums
Goal: Use Swift’s powerful collection types and enums.

🔸 Topics:
- Arrays, Sets, Dictionaries
- Iteration and manipulation
- Enumerations (Enums) and associated values
- Tuples

---

🔵 4. Object-Oriented and Protocol-Oriented Programming
Goal: Build and structure applications using Swift’s OOP and protocol-based design.

🔸 Topics:
- Structs vs Classes
- Initializers and Deinitializers
- Properties and Methods
- Inheritance
- Protocols and Protocol Extensions
- Access Control (private, public, etc.)
- Static and Class methods

🛠 Practice:
- Build models with structs and classes
- Create protocol-based components

---

🟣 5. Intermediate and Advanced Swift
Goal: Leverage advanced language features for robust and efficient code.

🔸 Topics:
- Closures
- Generics
- Error Handling (try, throw, catch)
- Functional Programming (map, filter, reduce)
- ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
- Memory Management
- Property Observers
- Type Casting

---

🟤 6. Swift Tools and Ecosystem
Goal: Work with Swift Package Manager and standard libraries.

🔸 Topics:
- Swift Package Manager (SPM)
- Importing and managing dependencies
- Common frameworks: Foundation, Combine, SwiftUI
- Unit testing with XCTest

---

⚫ 7. Specializations (Choose Your Path)
Choose based on your career focus.

🔹 iOS/macOS App Development
- UIKit and SwiftUI
- Storyboards and Programmatic UI
- ViewControllers and MVVM
- CoreData and Combine
- Navigation and Transitions

🔹 Swift on the Server
- Frameworks: Vapor, Hummingbird
- REST API development
- JSON handling
- Authentication

🔹 Game Development
- SpriteKit, SceneKit

---

🧠 8. Projects and Practice
Goal: Build real-world projects to apply your skills.

🛠 Project Ideas:
- To-do List App (SwiftUI)
- Weather App with API integration
- Expense Tracker
- Chat App using Firebase
- RESTful API using Vapor
