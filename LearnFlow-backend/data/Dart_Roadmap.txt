## 🛣️ Dart Programming Language Learning Roadmap

---

### 🟢 1. **Getting Started with Dart**

> **Goal:** Set up the Dart environment and write simple Dart programs.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Install Dart SDK or use DartPad (online)
* Understanding Dart tools (`dart` CLI commands)
* Hello World program
* DartPad for experimentation
* Dart syntax basics (statements, expressions)

---

### 🟡 2. **Dart Language Fundamentals**

> **Goal:** Learn core Dart concepts and syntax.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Variables (`var`, `final`, `const`)
* Data types (int, double, String, bool, dynamic)
* Basic operators and expressions
* Control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`, loops)
* Functions and anonymous functions (lambdas)
* Null safety and null-aware operators (`?`, `??`, `!`)

---

### 🟠 3. **Collections and Data Structures**

> **Goal:** Use Dart’s built-in collections to store and manipulate data.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Lists (arrays), Sets, Maps
* Iterating collections (`for`, `forEach`, `map`, `where`)
* Spread operator and collection if/for
* Working with generics

---

### 🔵 4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart**

> **Goal:** Understand and use Dart’s OOP features effectively.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Classes and objects
* Constructors and named constructors
* Fields, methods, and getters/setters
* Inheritance and method overriding
* Abstract classes and interfaces
* Mixins and extensions
* Static members

---

### 🟣 5. **Asynchronous Programming**

> **Goal:** Master Dart’s async features for non-blocking code.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Futures and async/await syntax
* Streams and stream controllers
* Error handling in async code (`try-catch`, `onError`)
* Isolates for concurrency (optional advanced topic)

---

### 🟤 6. **Functional Programming Concepts**

> **Goal:** Use functional programming paradigms in Dart.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* First-class functions
* Closures
* Higher-order functions (`map`, `reduce`, `fold`, `filter`)
* Immutability and pure functions

---

### ⚫ 7. **Dart Packages and Tools**

> **Goal:** Use Dart packages and tools to enhance productivity.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Using `pub` (package manager)
* Importing and using packages
* Writing your own packages
* Dart formatter and linter
* Unit testing with `test` package

---

### 🔵 8. **Flutter Development Basics** *(optional but highly recommended)*

> **Goal:** Apply Dart knowledge to build cross-platform apps with Flutter.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Flutter architecture overview
* Widgets and widget tree
* Stateful vs stateless widgets
* Handling user input and gestures
* Navigation and routing
* State management basics (`setState`, Provider, Riverpod, etc.)

---

### 🟣 9. **Backend Development with Dart**

> **Goal:** Build server-side applications with Dart.

#### 🔸 Topics:

* Using `dart:io` for file and socket programming
* Building REST APIs with frameworks like Aqueduct or Shelf
* Database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
* Authentication and middleware concepts

---

### ⚫ 10. **Projects and Practice**

> **Goal:** Build projects to solidify your Dart skills.

#### 🛠 Project Ideas:

* To-do list CLI app
* Simple REST API server
* Flutter mobile app (e.g., weather app, chat app)
* Real-time chat app using WebSockets
* Package/library published on pub.dev
